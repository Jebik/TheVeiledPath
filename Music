As an AI text-based model, I am not capable of generating sheet music or musical notes directly. However, I can provide you with simple descriptions and ideas for two piano themes that you could use for a game.

Light and Happy Theme:
In the key of C Major, begin with a playful melody using the notes C, E, G, and A. You could use a rhythmic pattern of eighth notes and quarter notes to create a sense of liveliness. The left hand could provide harmony by playing chords such as C Major, F Major, and G Major. Incorporate repeating motifs and arpeggios to tie the theme together and make it suitable for looping. The tempo could be moderately fast to evoke a joyful and energetic atmosphere.

Dark and Sad Theme:
In the key of A minor, create a melancholic melody using the notes A, C, D, and E. Employ a slower rhythmic pattern with quarter notes and half notes to emphasize the somber mood. The left hand could play chords like A minor, D minor, and E minor, with a slower tempo and perhaps using a sustain pedal for a more immersive feel. You could also include descending scales or chromatic notes to heighten the sense of sadness. Make sure the theme has a similar duration

Creating a full 2-minute song with detailed timestamps is quite complex for an AI text-based model. However, I can provide a simple sketch in the form of a lead sheet that you can expand upon and adjust to create the desired loop. Here's a basic structure using your requirements:

Light and Happy Theme:

Key: C Major
Time signature: 4/4
Tempo: 120 BPM (moderately fast)

Intro (4 measures):
1. C E G C (C Major chord, right hand)
2. *hold* 
3. F A C F (F Major chord, right hand)
4. *hold*

[Loop section]
(Each note entry represents 1 beat; add left-hand chords as desired)

Measure 1:
C (0.00) - E (0.50) - G (1.00) - G (1.50)
Measure 2:
E (2.00) - C (2.50) - A (3.00) - G (3.50)
Repeat these measures 30 times, which will give you a total duration of about 2 minutes, making it suitable for looping.

For the left hand, you can play the following chords within each measure to provide harmony

Yes, there are AI programs and tools specifically designed to generate music. Some popular ones include:

1. OpenAI Jukebox: Jukebox is a neural network designed to generate music, including rudimentary singing. It can be used to create songs in various styles and genres. More information can be found at: https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/

2. AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist): AIVA is an AI music composer that can create original scores for different styles and genres, including classical, jazz, and pop, based on the input provided. You can check out their website at: https://www.aiva.ai/

While these tools may not directly take the text-based information I provided as an input, you can use the general guidelines and suggestions to shape the generated music according to your requirements. You may need to explore each tool's features and settings to get the desired output.
