Sure! Let's break it down into several steps and provide some code samples to guide you. For starters, make sure you have Bevy and other useful dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.5"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

### Step 1: Define your objects and data

First, let's start by defining the structures to hold the information about your game objects (e.g., Square, Wall, Player).

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Square {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
    wall: Option<Wall>,
    key: Option<Key>,
    dimension: Dimension,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Wall {
    position: (f32, f32),
    dimension: Dimension,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Key {
    position: (f32, f32),
    dimension: Dimension,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum Dimension {
    A, B
}
```

### Step 2: Read the JSON data

Read the JSON file with the map settings and parse it into your structures.

```rust
use std::fs;

fn read_map_data(file_path: &str) -> Vec<Square> {
    let json_data = fs::read_to_string(file_path).expect("Unable to read the file");
    let map_data: Vec<Square> = serde_json::from_str(&json_data).expect("Failed to parse JSON data");
    map_data
}
```

### Step 3: Set up the Bevy engine and the game window

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let window_size = (1600, 900);

    App::build()
        .insert_resource(Msaa { samples: 4 })
        .insert_resource(WindowDescriptor {
            title: "2D Top View Game".to_string(),
            width: window_size.0 as f32,
            height: window_size.1 as f32,
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        // Add more system here
        .run();
}
```

### Step 4: Create the game systems and objects

Create systems to initialize the grid, generate the walls and borders, accept input for switching dimensions, and handle the player character.

```rust
fn setup_grid(
    commands: &mut Commands, 
    map_data: Res<Vec<Square>>
) {
    for square in &*map_data {
        // Create grid entities here, using the data from `square` with desired components
    }

    // Add collision entities for the border walls
}

fn setup_player(
    commands: &mut Commands,
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<ColorMaterial>>,
) {
    commands
        .spawn(SpriteComponents {
            // Choose an appropriate texture or material for the player
            material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.7, 0.7, 0.7).into()),
            sprite: Sprite::new(Vec2::new(32.0, 32.0)),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        // Other necessary components for the player
        .current_entity().unwrap();
}

fn handle_collisions(...) {
    // Implement simple collision detection and response here
}

fn handle_dimension_switching(...) {
    // Implement the logic to switch between dimensions and provide feedback to the player
}
```

After setting up the systems, add them to your Bevy app in the `main` function:

```rust
App::build()
    // ...
    .add_startup_system(setup_grid.system())
    .add_startup_system(setup_player.system())
    .add_system(handle_collisions.system())
    .add_system(handle_dimension_switching.system())
    // ...
    .run();
```

With these steps and code samples, you can build upon this foundation to create your 2D top view game in Bevy. Remember to adjust and add more components and systems to suit your specific game requirements.

Absolutely! I'll provide an example of creating a wall at a specific position with a texture, and show how to make it visible only in its respective dimension. To begin, create a `WallTexture` component to store the wall's texture handle, as well as a `VisibleInDimension` component to determine the wall's visibility according to the dimension.

```rust
use bevy::asset::{Handle};
use bevy::sprite::{TextureAtlas};

struct WallTexture(Handle<TextureAtlas>);
struct VisibleInDimension(Dimension);
```

Then, create a system to manage the wall's visibility based on the dimension. In this example, let's assume you have a `CurrentDimension` resource to keep track of the game's active dimension.

```rust
struct CurrentDimension(Dimension);

fn update_wall_visibility(
    current_dimension: Res<CurrentDimension>,
    mut query: Query<(&VisibleInDimension, &mut Visible)>,
) {
    for (dim, mut visible) in query.iter_mut() {
        visible.is_visible = current_dimension.0 == dim.0;
    }
}
```

Add the `CurrentDimension` resource and the `update_wall_visibility` system to your Bevy app in the `main` function:

```rust
App::build()
    // ...
    .insert_resource(CurrentDimension(Dimension::A))
    .add_system(update_wall_visibility.system())
    // ...
    .run();
```

Now, let's extend the `setup_grid` system by spawning a wall entity with the required components.

First, load the texture atlas for the walls:

```rust
fn load_wall_texture_atlas(asset_server: Res<AssetServer>, texture_atlases: ResMut<Assets<TextureAtlas>>) -> Handle<TextureAtlas> {
    let texture_handle = asset_server.load("path/to/your/texture_atlas.png");

    let texture_atlas = TextureAtlas::from_grid(texture_handle, Vec2::new(32.0, 32.0), 1, 1); // Adjust grid size based on your texture atlas
    texture_atlases.add(texture_atlas)
}
```

Add the `setup_grid` system:

```rust
fn setup_grid(
    commands: &mut Commands, 
    map_data: Res<Vec<Square>>,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    texture_atlases: ResMut<Assets<TextureAtlas>>,
) {
    let wall_texture_atlas_handle = load_wall_texture_atlas(asset_server, texture_atlases);

    for square in &*map_data {
        if let Some(wall) = &square.wall {
            commands
                .spawn(SpriteSheetComponents {
                    texture_atlas: wall_texture_atlas_handle.clone(),
                    sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(0), // Use the appropriate index in the texture atlas for the wall texture
                    transform: Transform::from_translation(Vec3::new(wall.position.0, wall.position.1, 0.0)),
                    ..Default::default()
                })
                .with(WallTexture(wall_texture_atlas_handle.clone()))
                .with(VisibleInDimension(wall.dimension.clone()));
        }
    }
}
```

This will spawn a wall entity with a texture atlas, set its position according to the `Wall` object from the JSON, and set its `VisibleInDimension` component based on the associated dimension. The `update_wall_visibility` system will then take care of changing the wall's visibility based on the `CurrentDimension`.

Remember to change the texture atlas path and grid size in the `load_wall_texture_atlas` function based on your specific texture requirements.

Yes, a simple solution for saving and loading high scores can be implemented using the `serde` and `serde_json` crates that we added to the project earlier. You can easily store high scores as a JSON file.

To save high scores, you can create a structure to hold the necessary information. For example, a `HighScoreEntry` structure with a map name and a score, and another structure `HighScores` that holds a list of `HighScoreEntry`. 

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq)]
struct HighScoreEntry {
    map_name: String,
    score: u32,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, Default)]
struct HighScores {
    entries: Vec<HighScoreEntry>,
}
```

Now, create functions to save and load high scores using `serde_json`:

```rust
use std::io::{Read, Write};
use std::fs::{File, OpenOptions};

const HIGH_SCORES_FILE: &str = "highscores.json";

fn save_high_scores(high_scores: &HighScores) {
    let high_scores_json = serde_json::to_string_pretty(high_scores).expect("Failed to convert to JSON");

    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .write(true)
        .create(true)
        .truncate(true)
        .open(HIGH_SCORES_FILE)
        .expect("Failed to open highscores.json file");

    file.write_all(high_scores_json.as_bytes()).expect("Failed to write highscores to file");
}

fn load_high_scores() -> HighScores {
    if let Ok(mut file) = File::open(HIGH_SCORES_FILE) {
        let mut high_scores_json = String::new();
        file.read_to_string(&mut high_scores_json).expect("Failed to read highscores.json file");
        serde_json::from_str(&high_scores_json).expect("Failed to parse highscores JSON")
    } else {
        HighScores::default()
    }
}
```

With these functions, you can load high scores at the beginning of your game and save them when necessary. For instance, when the player completes a map, update the high scores and save it to the file:

```rust
fn update_high_scores(map_name: String, new_score: u32) {
    let mut high_scores = load_high_scores();

    match high_scores.entries.iter_mut().find(|e| e.map_name == map_name) {
        Some(entry) => {
            if new_score > entry.score {
                entry.score = new_score;
            }
        }
        None => {
            high_scores.entries.push(HighScoreEntry {
                map_name,
                score: new_score,
            });
        }
    }

    save_high_scores(&high_scores);
}
```

Call the `update_high_scores()` function when the player completes a map to update the high scores. This simple implementation will store the high scores as a JSON file and update them whenever needed.
